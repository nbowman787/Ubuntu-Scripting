# This script demonstrates parsing the command line
# created 2015-10-08 by nathan

# we accept -h|--help, -a|--auto, -d|--debug level
# we require directory1, directory2

# --auto should set a variable
# --debug should save a level in a variable
#      level must be given and is expected to be a number between 1 and 3 inclusive
# --help should print out a syntax diagram

# both directories must exist
# if the user doesn't give 2 directories, ask for them using read

# if the command given was invalid,
#       print out an error and exit with a status 2
# otherwise display the arguments given by the user
